    "story": "Number four, Privet Drive, was a house as normal as any in the sleepy town of Little Whinging, but within its walls lurked a story yet untold. Here dwelt Harry Potter, a boy with unruly black hair, bright green eyes, and a peculiar lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead, hidden from the world beneath a mop of hair. The Dursleys, with whom he resided, were his only family yet they shared no bonds of affection with the young orphan. Nothing about Harry's life with his aunt and uncle was extraordinary, nothing that is, until the letters began to arrive.\n\nVernon Dursley, a man of beefy stature and purplish face, particularly when angered, was quick to notice the oddness of the envelopes addressed to 'Mr. H. Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs.' He snapped the first one from the postman's hands, his small eyes flickering with a combination of fear and disgust. Determined to keep normalcy within his household, Vernon tore the letter into pieces before Harry could so much as lay a finger on it. But as the days passed, more and more letters found their way to the house, each one ignored and destroyed, the truth they held within kept secret.\n\nOn the eve of his eleventh birthday, Harry lay in the gloom of the smallest bedroom, a privilege he had been granted only after Dudley had once again thrown a tantrum. As the clock ticked closer to midnight, he considered the strange events that had led him to this day, the way the letters had multiplied, and how the Dursleys' fury had reached a boiling point, driving them to the extreme of harboring him in a dingy shack out at sea, where the waves crashed endlessly against the rocks, much like Harry's questions against the silence. It was here, as the tempest raged outside, that Harry waited, hope mingling with unease, for a revelation that might never come or might just change his life forever.",

      "A loud, thunderous knock shatters the silence, frightening the Dursleys. Harry decides to take a leap of courage and opens the door himself, ready to face whatever stands on the other side.",
      "Against the primal fear that seemed to clasp the hearts of the Dursleys that night, Harry chooses to remain still, not wanting to provoke his uncleâ€™s anger further. He waits, letting someone else react to the unexpected knock echoing in the shack.",
      "With his heart pounding against his ribcage, Harry stealthily moves to peer through a crack in the wooden walls, determined to catch a glimpse of the late-night visitor before the Dursleys can intervene."
